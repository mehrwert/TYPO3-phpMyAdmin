# phpMyAdmin Database Management Utility for TYPO3

phpMyAdmin is a free software tool written in PHP, intended to handle the administration of MySQL over 
the Web. phpMyAdmin supports a wide range of operations on MySQL, MariaDB and Drizzle. Frequently 
used operations (managing databases, tables, columns, relations, indexes, users, permissions, etc) 
can be performed via the user interface, while you still have the ability to directly 
execute any SQL statement - see http://www.phpmyadmin.net/
